# bimm143

This is my work from [BIMM143 @ UC San Diego](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F19/). First time on GitHub.


Push in GitHub: Sends our updates to the interwebs. Need to commit before you push.

Pull in Github: Takes updates made from the interwebs/on the interwebs and brings it to RStudio. This mimics another collaborator doing work.
